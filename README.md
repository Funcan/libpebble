libpebble and pb-sdk
====================

Those tools that are now part of Pebble SDK are based on the original libpebble by Hexxeh (Liam McLoughlin).

Original project: https://github.com/Hexxeh/libpebble

This version of libpebble uses websockets to talk to Pebble watch instead of Bluetooth. As of SDK 2.0, this is the recommended way.

Refer to Pebble SDK Documentation for help on using pb-sdk.py.
